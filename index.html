                programming. I have been minor experience in web development using Spring Boot, involving both frontend and backend. I have also worked on
                few Machine Learning projects as part of curriculum in my Master's programme.

                After completing my B.Tech, I started working at Samsung Research Institute as a software developer. I got various awards during my 2 year stay at 
                Sasmung, some notable ones being Employee of the Quarter and Proffessional SOftware Competency award. It was an enjoyable journey with loads of stuff
                to learn and ramp up procedure of Samsung allowed me to ease into the corporate life, much faster than I had thought possible. I left Samsung, so as 
                to prepare for GATE and enroll in a Master's programme.

                Since childhood, I have dabbled in many a things to explore my interests and hobbies. I love to draw sketches and I have a fondness for martial arts.
                I couldn't continue with martial arts after learning for a few months due to health issues, and later on I picked up workouts and running in my daily 
                routine. I especially love bike trips along sea shores and marine drives, feeling the cool salty breeze of the sea and the roaring crashing sound of 
                the waves. Apart from that I indulge in most of the things that every other 7 billion souls on this planet find entertaining, i.e. movies and tv series. 
                I have read a few novels, some Chetan Bhagat pieces, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire and a few other 
                non descript ones.
